                <p style="font-style: italic;">Educational workshops are interactive sessions designed to educate participants on specific topics, build skills, and encourage learning in an engaging, hands-on environment. These workshops can vary widely in format—from lectures and demonstrations to group activities and practical exercises—making them adaptable to a range of audiences and learning objectives. When planning a workshop, it’s crucial to identify the audience's needs, set clear learning objectives, and develop an agenda that allows participants to actively participate and practice new skills. Effective workshops often incorporate multimedia, discussions, and Q&A segments to keep participants engaged and to ensure the information is both memorable and applicable. </p>

                <h3>Recycling Guidelines</h3>
                <img src="https://i.ibb.co/1Tb2G2m/recycling-guidelines.jpg" alt="" height="400px" width="750px">
                <p style="font-style: italic;">Recycling guidelines provide essential information on how to sort, prepare, and dispose of materials to ensure they are correctly recycled. These guidelines often specify which materials are acceptable (e.g., plastics, paper, metals, glass) and which are not, helping to avoid contamination in recycling streams. Proper preparation, such as rinsing containers, flattening boxes, and separating items, is crucial for maintaining quality and efficiency in recycling facilities. Guidelines may also include details on handling hazardous materials and electronics, directing them to specialized facilities.</p>
